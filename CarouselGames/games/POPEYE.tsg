D:it:Il giocatore controlla Popeye con il compito di raccogliere i simboli prima che cadano in acqua che la sua amata, la bellissima Olive Oyl, gli lancia contro. I ruoli degli antagonisti sono occupati da Bruto, il brutto spasimante sempre antipatico e geloso, e la strega di mare con il suo tremendo avvoltoio Bernard, che non lasciano mai Popeye tranquillo. Il gioco ha tre schermi diversi e un livello Ã¨ completato quando avrai raccolto un certo numero di simboli.
