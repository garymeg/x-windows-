D:it:Lode Runner Ã¨ un gioco di piattaforme in cui bisogna raccogliere i tesori attraverso 150 livelli. Fino a 5 nemici cercheranno di impedirtelo. Puoi correre, usare le scale, arrampicarti lungo le sbarre e raccogliere tesori. Non appena hai raccolto tutte le scatole, una melodia suona e appare una scala invisibile. Non puoi saltare ma hai un'arma con te con la quale puoi sciogliere i mattoni per un certo tempo. Non importa da quanto tu possa cadere, non ti farai del male.
